# Odell-AlaskaSalmon

This project is part of a [class exercise](https://sr320.github.io/course-fish497-2018/assignments/mini-project/) where we create mini projects of our own. My project uses salmon spatial and biological data from A and C creek in Alaska collected from 2004 to 2016. 

## Packages needed

**Tidyverse**: set of packages that work well together because of shared common data representations

```
library(tidyverse)
```

## Files 

1. **data/autocorrelation_sections_corrected_051118_final.csv**: 2004-2016 data of spawning sockeye salmon in A + C creek in Alaska.
2. **scripts/Odell-AlaskaSalmon**: Manipulating data to answer questions about spawning dynamics

## Questions we want to answer

1. Does return time and distance vary between male and female? 
2. What is the general population structure such as number of fish per year, per creek and sex ratios?
3. How long do fish generally stay in the creek?
4. Which sections of the creek are fish generally found?
